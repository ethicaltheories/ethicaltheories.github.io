In pursuit of a detailed overview of IS literature related to ethical theories and AI, we have adopted the following systematic approach to compile a comprehensive list.

We initiated our systematic categorization with the identification of journals listed under the "Wirtschaftsinformatik" category in the VHB JOURQUAL 3, which laid the groundwork for our core list of journals. We prioritized the inclusion of journals from the senior scholars’ "basket of 11," a compilation of premier journals, recognizing their significant influence (Lowry et al., 2013); notably, Information Systems Research (ISR), Management Information Systems Quarterly (MISQ), and Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS) are also featured in the acclaimed Financial Times Top 50 Journals (“FT 50”) list.

Subsequently, we examined the journals outlined by Walstrom and Hardgrave (2001), incorporating those with a "pure IS" rating of 0.8 or above into our collection. Many were already present in the VHB list, and we supplemented it with any that were absent. Our next step involved evaluating journals with a "hybrid IS" score of 0.6 or higher as used by Walstrom and Hardgrave (2001), noting those that appeared in the VHB list and taking their impact factor into account.

Additionally, we aligned our findings with the framework proposed by Levy and Ellis (2006), assimilating journals that corresponded with the VHB rankings of A+, A, and B and were concurrent with either one of the aforementioned lists into our final sample.

Moreover, we manually incorporated the journals DATA BASE for Advances in Information Systems and Communications of the Association for Information Systems (CAIS), which, despite their VHB ranking of C, are well-regarded in the IS community.

In parallel, we applied a similar approach to conference proceedings. By cross-referencing the compilations by Walstrom and Hardgrave (2001) and Levy and Ellis (2006), we included those proceedings that were recognized by both sources.
